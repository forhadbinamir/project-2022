            <p>According to Forbes, studies show that having a dedicated workspace is important to your ability to
                focus. If you set aside a specific ‘work’ spot in your home that’s free of distraction, you’re likely to
                concentrate better. If you have a guest bedroom, consider repurposing it as an office. You could also
                consider clearing a space at the kitchen counter or dining table for work.</p>
